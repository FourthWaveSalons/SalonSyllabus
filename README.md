SalonSyllabus
=============

We've been playing with the syllabus for the FourthWave salons for neatly 2 years now, and we would love some fresh ideas/comments on it! Please add new topics or readings, comment on existing ones, and add any feedback that you think will help improve the salons!


Suggested Topics

A few notes:

Below are some of the recommended topics of discussions and materials (quotes, videos, articles, books, films) to go along with them.

We would like to emphasize that these are merely suggestions. The two discussion leaders for each session will be able to decide how to steer the conversation and, with the suggestion of the rest of the group,  what materials to engage with.

In fact, we highly encourage our participants to share the readings (+ materials) that they love - even outside of our actual sessions! (We will create a panlist to facilitate the sharing).

“…Someday, sometime, you will be sitting somewhere. A berm overlooking a pond in Vermont. The lip of the Grand Canyon at sunset. A seat on the subway. And something bad will have happened: You will have lost someone you loved, or failed at something at which you badly wanted to succeed. And sitting there, you will fall into the center of yourself. You will look for some core to sustain you. And if you have been perfect all your life and have managed to meet all the expectations of your family, your friends, your community, your society, chances are excellent that there will be a black hole where that core ought to be. I don’t want anyone I know to take that terrible chance. And the only way to avoid it is to listen to that small voice inside you that tells you to make mischief, to have fun, to be contrarian, to go another way. George Eliot wrote, ‘It is never too late to be what you might have been.’ It is never too early, either.” - Anna Quindlen



“If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; be kind anyway. If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies; succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; be honest and frank anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; build anyway.”

- Mother Theresa



“If you don’t get lost, there’s a chance you may never be found.”

- Anonymous



“Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.”

- Henry David Thoreau



“But the point is this: It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It’s not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right, your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound re-invention.”

- Conan O’Brien



“But today I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come. The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.”

- Conan O’Brien



“Man cannot remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble and the sculptor.”

- Alexis Carrel

What does thinking for one’s self means? 
What’s the difference between knowing and believing?


Potential discussion points —

“The ancestor to every action is thought.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson



“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” - Aristotle



“The difficult part in an argument is not to defend one’s opinion but rather to know it.” - Andre Maurois



“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given to you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will find them gradually, without noticing it, and live along some distant day into the answer.”

- Rainer Maria Rilke



“Living is being born slowly. It would be a little too easy if we could borrow ready-made souls.”

- Antoine de Saint-Exupery



“…contemplation as a human faculty is distinctly different from thought and reasoning.”

- Hannah Arendt



“It is easier to fight for one’s principles than to live up to them.” - Alfred Adler

“When you examine the lives of the most influential people who have ever walked among us, you discover one thread that winds through them all. They have been aligned first with their spiritual nature and only then with their physical selves.” - Albert Einstein



“Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece - by thought, choice, and determination.” - John Morley



“Integrity is telling myself the truth. And honesty is telling the truth to other people.” - Spencer Johnson

“If you live the sacred and despise the ordinary, you are still bobbing in the ocean of delusion.” - Zen Master Lin-Chi



“Genuine compassion is based on a clear acceptance or recognition that others, like oneself, want happiness and have the right to overcome suffering. On that basis one develops concern about the welfare of others, irrespective of one’s attitude to oneself. That is compassion.” - Dalai Lama



“The universal human laws - need, loved for the beloved, fear, hunger, periodic exaltation, the kindness that rises up naturally in the absence of fear / hunger / pain - are constant, predictable…What a wonderful thing to know: that one’s own desires are mappable onto strangers.” - George Saunders

Potential discussion points -

“There is a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.” - Madeleine Albright



On Mentorship: “The mark of someone who is secure and confident and humble in themselves is the ability to interact with people of all ages and power. They are not seduced by those with more power nor threatened. They do not seek out relationships based on an agenda, a benefit that they are seeking. This allows them to genuinely reach out to others - even younger individuals or people with less power. The easiest way to spot a secure and confident leader, then, is by seeing those who mentor others.” - Tiffany

12. On the “Life Worth Living”

Core questions —

Many philosophers discuss the purpose of life or how to live an “examined life” in their works… but how does that translate into experiences? 
How do we learn to communicate our values and make decisions based on these values? 
What keeps us accountable to these values?
Potential discussion points —

“If you look straight ahead at nighttime, the brightest things you see are the streetlight, or the porch light, or the car light. Because of the curious urban phenomenon of light pollution, these appear to be the only lights around. But step outside the city and then look up—and you see the fires that have forever made mankind dream. Stars.

In the dim haze of city lights, we can lose sight of the things above us. As a result, it’s easy to settle for the things directly in front of us. It’s easy to settle for the streetlight or the porch light or the car light; that is, it’s easy to settle for the things practically being handed to us after graduating from this place: creature comfort, a good reputation, a cozy paycheck. I don’t mean to say these things are bad—streetlights are good, especially in New Haven—but the difficulty always lies not so much in separating the bad from the good, but the good from the best. The dim haze of the merely good can crowd out the truly high, bright, and beautiful. And we guard against this—because a streetlight, as it were, can’t hold a candle to stars.

So you and I—let’s continue to look up. Let’s seek out the things bright enough to live for: a world of wonder, the world through which the life found looking in will walk alongside the lives found looking out. “

Are we still fighting to make some progress?
And how do we measure “success” in the movement?
